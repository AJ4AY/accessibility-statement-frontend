accessibilityProblems:
  - The aria-expanded attribute has been used on conditionality revealing checkbox elements which is not allowed. Also, screen reader users are not always notified when conditionally revealed checkbox elements are expanded or collapsed.
  - The multiple ‘Edit’ elements contain the same id attribute value
  - The ‘Proof of trading address’ answer elements contain the same id attribute value
  - The ‘Confirm answers and send application’ button is not highlighted by a visible focus indicator when in focus. This means that keyboard only users may struggle to determine where their focus is on the page.
  - The ‘check the guidance (opens in a new window or tab)’ is not descriptive of its destination or purpose when navigating out of context.

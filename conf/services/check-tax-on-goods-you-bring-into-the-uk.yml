accessibilityProblems:
  - The page ‘What other goods do you want to add?’ does not function correctly for users using Internet Explorer, meaning these users cannot declare any ‘other goods’
  - On the page ‘What other goods do you want to add?’, the heading has not been correctly labelled, which may make it difficult to interact with the page for users with assistive technology
  - The user sees a pop-up window if they do not interact with a page for 15 minutes, which tells them their answers will be deleted unless they click continue. The pop-up is missing a header which would help users with assistive technology to understand the content and purpose of the pop-up
  - On the page ‘What other goods do you want to add?’, when a user selects an item from the autocomplete field, the item is added to the page but this is not announced by screen readers on Google Chrome or Firefox. Also, when a user removes an item they’ve added, the screen reader does not announce whether this has been successful or not
  - On the page ‘Make your payment’, when you use keyboard tabbing to focus on an input box, the border that surrounds the box is not bold or contrasted enough. This may make it difficult for visually impaired users to see what they’re focusing on
  - On the page ‘Enter your details’, the input boxes asking for personal details such as name and email address do not have an autocomplete function that would fill in answers given previously on other websites. This would help avoid potential mistakes
  - On the page ‘Make your payment’, the headings have not been labelled in a logical order, which may make it difficult to interact with the page for users with assistive technology

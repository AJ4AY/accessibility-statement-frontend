  -     the layout structure of the country lookup page causes a number of issues – for example, the label is not readable by assistive technology
  -     on the Are you bringing any of the following goods? page, when clicking on any of the radio buttons the hint text is not repeated
  -     the service shows an invalid request page instead of warning the user if they have been inactive for a period of time
  -     on the Review your goods and Check your answers pages, there are multiple Change links which are not distinguishable for screen reader users
  -     the error messages for both email address inputs have been set as Enter an email address so are not distinguishable for screen reader users – these error messages should be unique
  -     some pages may be difficult for assistive technologies to read because of incorrect markup and labelling
  -     on the Review your goods and Check your answers pages the remove link is not ordered correctly as part of the summary list
  -     some elements do not have unique IDs which may make it difficult for assistive technology to navigate the content
  -     on the Check your answers page the input element for the payment due is ordered incorrectly
  -     On the payment summary page, there is a link which does not behave correctly  –  it is not announced by screen readers and does not respond to the spacebar key press appropriately

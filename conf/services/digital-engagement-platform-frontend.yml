accessibilityProblems:
  - Mobile users using screen readers may find it difficult to navigate or interact with the chat window or the other content on the launch page
  - There is styling on the ‘Support for coronavirus’ digital assistant page that may make interaction difficult for users who use style overlays to make pages more readable
  - Some answers in the digital assistant that have links have ‘(opens in a new tab)’ after each link, whereas others have ‘Links will open in a new tab’ once at the start of the answer. This could be frustrating for users with assistive technologies as link behaviour may not be clear or consistent
  - Users using the JAWS screen reader may experience confusing changes in focus when being given multiple answers
  - Users using VoiceOver on iPhone and Mac and users using NVDA may experience confusing changes in focus when interacting with answers, links and new tabs
  - Users using Chrome on Android are unable to use pinch and zoom gestures once the chat window has launched
  - The button icon used to turn alerts on and off does not look different enough in its on or off state, or different enough from the print icon. It also behaves differently to the print icon. Additionally, users with assistive technologies may find it difficult to interact with the button
  - Users on smaller screens may see a menu link that does not give any interactive options

accessibilityProblems:
  - Page titles do not match the corresponding page heading. When a screen reader is being used this could mislead you about the purpose of the page.
  - If you’re inactive for a period of time, the service automatically logs you out without giving a warning and there is no way for you to extend your session.
  - Navigation within the service may be difficult when using a screen reader because some links are not easy to identify and require listening to all the page’s main content first.
  - When the font size is resized or a smaller screen is used, text in tables can be obscured by other items on the page, making it hard to read. Also, the tables can appear to overflow the edge of the screen, meaning part of the table is not visible.

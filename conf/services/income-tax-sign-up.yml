accessibilityProblems:
  - When selecting ‘Current tax year’ or 'Next tax year', hidden content about what the user needs to do is revealed. This extra information may not be announced by users of VoiceOver or Jaws.
  - The service name link at the top of each page does go anywhere.
  - On a number of pages, users who use screen magnification will not be able to see some content as it overlaps other content or it goes beyond the visual edge of the page.
  - When users have completed signing up, the messages do not fit properly on the confirmation screen. This can cause horizontal scrolling in addition to vertical scrolling, which can cause problems for anyone with motor impairment.
  - When the focus is on any error message, there is poor colour contrast that will make it difficult for visually impaired users to read.

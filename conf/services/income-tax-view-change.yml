accessibilityProblems:
  - Keyboard only users may struggle with some backlinks and toggles. They will need to be tabbed through each time by a keyboard user after using a skip link to get to the main content.
  - Screen reader users may struggle to use some of the tables on the ‘Tax Years’ page. Some tables do not describe their purposes or the rows and columns as a screen reader user moves between tables and cells.
  - Screen reader users may struggle to find correct values in some lists. Some description lists are not identifying the term so some screen reader users are not notified of the number of items in the list.
  - Keyboard only users might struggle to use some of the buttons and will need to use the enter key instead of the spacebar. Links styled as buttons are not labelled correctly for assistive technology users.
  - When switching to the Welsh language, not all the content is translated and remains in English. This means content will be incorrectly pronounced for screen readers.

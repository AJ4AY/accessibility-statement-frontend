accessibilityProblems:
  - there are some table headers that contain misleading text which may cause confusion for users
  - some search bars don’t behave as expected making navigation difficult for users of screen readers
  - some of the colour combinations are low contrast and are likely to be difficult for people with low vision to read
  - abbreviations have been used throughout the service, including within link text and headings on some pages. Some users may have difficulty in understanding the abbreviations, especially when navigating out of context
milestones:
  - description: On many pages in the service, after a user submits a search the user’s focus is returned to the top of the page, without informing them of the search results.

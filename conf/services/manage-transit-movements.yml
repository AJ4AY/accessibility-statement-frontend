accessibilityProblems:
  - The label for the place of declaration is from a different page. Screen-reader users will be presented with the wrong information and voice-recognition users may struggle with referencing the component.
  - The legend for removing official customs seals does not describe the purpose of each selection available when screen-reader users navigate the page ‘out of context’.
milestones:
  - description:
      The accessible name for user interface components did not contain the text that is presented visually as the label.
      This fails WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name (Level A).

accessibilityProblems:
  - When the ‘sign out’ link has focus there is not enough contrast for some users to make out the text.
  - Some fields, such as addresses, do not have any autocomplete attributes. These help users enter details more than once or to assist with future entries.
  - When some of the country fields have focus there is not enough contrast. Some users will not know which element has keyboard focus.
  - The tables on some pages are visual only. The column headings do not appear to have a relationship to the content aligned below them.
  - The mobile version of some pages have no styling applied. This makes the content difficult to read. The headings appear to have no visual relationship to the content either. Some links appear to be a single link.
  - The change links have repeated content. It will read to screen readers as “change change answers”. Some link texts are not specific enough and could apply to anything. The position of some links appear before the data. Some users will have to backtrack to select it, once they have heard all the data.
  - Some of the visually-hidden support links in the footer are in Welsh when the rest of the page is in English. They do not have the right language mark-up to read it out in Welsh.
  - All country autocomplete fields should let users know the number of results. This is not working for Mac Voiceover users.
  - Some of the page titles and heading level 1 names do not match.
  - On some pages the input field is missing a label. Also, the hint messaging is not associated with the input.
  - The change link for consignee EORI confirmation does not include the correct information.
  - When users input values using Voice Control, it inserts a leading space.

accessibilityProblems:
  - After using a search field, the focus returns to the start of the page making it difficult for some users to access their search results.
  - No status message was provided for screen reader users when encountering a change of content on a page.
milestones:
  - description: After submitting a search in one search input field, the focus returns to the start of the page. This means that users who rely on a keyboard alone to navigate have to tab through all previous content to access the search results. It also means that users who rely on a screen reader are not informed of their search results when they are produced, or that their focus has been returned to the start of the page. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.3 (Focus Order).

  - description: Some search fields do not have the correct error status message for screen reader users. This means that these users are left unaware of the error. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.3 (Status Messages).

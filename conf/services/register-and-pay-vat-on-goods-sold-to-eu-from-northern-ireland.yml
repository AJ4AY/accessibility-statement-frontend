accessibilityProblems:
  - description: Screen reader users will find it hard to understand the meaning of change links on the sales pages, as information about which country the sales are going to is missing.
  - description: When entering a long string of text it does not break to fit the container it is being added to, so it will overflow. Users will have to scroll horizontally to read it. This will also be a problem if the text size is increased. Additionally, seeing it will be difficult as it is white text against a pale background.

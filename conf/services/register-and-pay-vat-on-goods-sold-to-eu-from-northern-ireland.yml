accessibilityProblems:
  - Change links on the sales pages do not include the country name. Screen reader users will find them hard to understand.
  - Text boxes have poor colour contrast of white text on a pale background. Text boxes do not contain long strings of text correctly, especially when the text size is increased.
milestones:
  - description: Visually hidden text for 'Change' and 'remove' links do not include country of goods departure, and renders the code instead. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose.

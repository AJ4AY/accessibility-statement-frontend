accessibilityProblems:
  - When the timeout warning message appears on screen, there are then two headings on the same page. This can make it more difficult for screen reader users to understand the page layout and content.
  - Users can be timed out after a short period of inactivity without any prior warning. This can make it more difficult for users of assistive technology as logging back into the service can be time-consuming and a challenge.
  - The content for authorised officials can be confusing for screen reader users. The list is conveyed over one line and can be disorientating to listen to.
  - Accessing the ‘Cymraeg’ link is difficult due to the poor colour contrast. The contrast of blue and green means that some users will struggle to see the font.
